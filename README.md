# CTFs and Wargames
My name is Alex Ilgayev and I have a my hobby is solving security challenges.
I made a repository of a CTFs and Wargames collection with their appropriate writeup, for learning purposes.

Hope you enjoy it !

## Tools
All the challenges were solved using Ubuntu 18.04 distro on the great [WSL (Windows Subsystem on Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) platform.
I used vairious PT and reversing tools on Ubuntu (GDB, etc) and Python developing language with [pwn-tools](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/).
