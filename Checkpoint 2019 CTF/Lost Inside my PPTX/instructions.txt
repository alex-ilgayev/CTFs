Oh my, I'm locked outside my car! I mean, my car is right here but... I've lost my key!

My car doesn't require a physical key, though. It's a digital one. Luckily, I've once written it in an odd way... 
Please help me find it! I'm running late for dinner O_o

In the attached file "real_key.rar" you'll find a lot of power point files. My key hides in there, as I'll explain below.

Luckliy, I've also created a "small_key.rar", so we can easily play around with it. Extract this one first.

The first relevant powerpoint file is called "START.pptx". Open it.

As you'll see, it contains some slides. Every slide has text in the following format:
<CHARACTER>, <NEXT_PRESENTATION_NAME>, <SLIDE_NUMBER>

Each relevant presentation holds a single character from my key, in a single slide. Not all presentations are relevant, though.
For "START.pptx", this is guaranteed to be the first slide. As you can see, it displays the following text:

`L, E26DWA33X6.pptx, 10`

You can ignore the rest of the slides - as only one slide is relevant in every (relevant) presentation.
This means that the first character for my key is `L`. The next relevant character can be found in slide 10 of presentation E26DWA33X6.pptx.

Let's go there:
`5, PRZ12DA3D8.pptx, 1`

So our next character is `5`. The next relevant character is in the first slide of PRZ12DA3D8.pptx, let's go there:
`M, A6LLDC9D18.pptx, 12`

So our  character is `M`. The next one will be in slide 12 of A6LLDC9D18.pptx. Let's go there...
Wait, it doesn't exist! This means we're done with the key, and it is:
`L5M`.

Note that all the other presentations file were irrelevant for solving this.

I could have done this without you, of course, but my real key is much longer. It's written in the presentations in "real_key.rar" in the same mechanism, though. So you know what you need to do.

My mom just called, dinner is getting cold. Please help me!
