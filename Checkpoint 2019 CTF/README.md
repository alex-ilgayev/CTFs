# Checkpoint CTF 2019 Writeup

Like every year, Checkpoint released their annual [CTF competition](https://csa.checkpoint.com).
This time they promised that the best solvers will be invited to the CSA - Checkpoint Security Academy, a training for security researchers.

The CTF had various challenges in the topics of: Reversing, Development, Misc, and Crypto.
I had great time solving the challenges (unfortunately hasn't managed to solve them all), and because Checkpoint hiring process has ended I allow myself to post here the writeups for the one I managed to solve.

Hope you enjoy, and thanks to the research team in Checkpoint for the CTF !
